For some odd reason if you observe number of total collisions of 2 objects where their difference in mass is by 100 to the power of n, where n is integer, 
and n >= 0, total number of collisions will produce the digits of PI, where the amount of digits of PI directly depend on value n, 
and one object is stationary in front of an immovable wall while the other object slides towards the object in front of the wall. 
All of this is happening on a frictionless surface without any other Forces of resistance, in the system.

In the field below you can enter numerical value for mass of second object. You may also enter in the format: a ^ b, where you enter some float or int for a and b and use the character '^' to make b the exponent of a.
